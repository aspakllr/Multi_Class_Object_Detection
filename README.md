### Multi_Class_Object_Detection

Detection of object category and its bounding box coordinates.

* The dataset used for the experiments is a subset of the Caltech 101 dataset: http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/.
* The subset consisted of three(out of the original 101) object categories: octopus, butterfly and hedgehog.
* data_prep.py --> saves information (names, bbox coordinates, class label) about the images in csv files
* detection.py --> dataset preprocessing + training + predictions
